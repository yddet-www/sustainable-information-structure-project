Project 1

Overview 

The professor gave me the contents of a website that he wrote and designed with collaborators several years ago: The Research Paper Toolbox. The site was originally to serve as a resource for incoming graduate students. Although they did our best to create a unified information structure for the site, it was a “design by committee” project with a limited timeframe to develop a final version, so it has several inconsistencies and limited ability to sustainably expand or modify content in the future.

The overall instructional design architecture is a module-based learning environment with self-assessments at the end of each module. The professor have preserved that module structure, but that is all the information structure information he gave me. I inferred the rest from the stylistic cues in the document that imply the semantic relationship between elements and execute your markup based on the following principles: 

<ol>
  <li>
    The document should conform to the W3C Specifications on valid HTML5 and should pass validation;
  </li>
  <li>
    The site should be extensible to accommodate additional modules as they become available, meaning  you should provide a template for the inclusion of a new module that anyone with     your level of familiarity with HTML5 can successfully develop into a fully-formed module;
  </li>
  <li>
    The stylistic choices, while not elaborate, should use CSS to present the information in a coherent structure that a user can follow as they engage in self-directed learning (HTML     navigation should support this feature, both within modules and in a top-level navigation that makes it easy for users to progress through  the course).
  </li>
  <li>
    The final site should have file names and directory structures that an outsider could reasonably understand if they inherited the project.
  </li>
</ol>
